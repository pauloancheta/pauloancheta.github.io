<p>It's actually pretty hard for me to write about myself. So I will get back to this later</p>
<!--
<p>January 1st 2015 afternoon, I was sitting on my couch with my best friend Paolo (yes, we have the same name just different spelling) with rum on my left hand and a ciggarette on the other, pondering what I'm going to do with my life. At this time, I have been a cook for about 7 years and have a really bad case of back pains.</p>

<p>I have injured myself lifting vegetables around year 2 of being a cook. I did not lift the box of vegetables properly and the whole day after that I was in pain. I had to be taken to the hospital and they have given me morphine just so I can calm down. I've had recurring back pain ever since.</p>

<p>I knew that I could not be a cook anymore and I had to do something about it. tl;dr that same afternoon, I gave my 2 weeks notice and enrolled at CodeCore.</p>
