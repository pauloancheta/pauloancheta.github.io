      • &nbsp;2017 Pricing<br>
      Due to changing requirements of the 2017 Pricing, I believe we have solutioned the most flexible
      pricing service (it just reads from a YML file).

      • &nbsp;DevOps<br>
      We had an 11 step process for deployment with multiple points of failure. We have brought it down
      to 2-click-deployment process.

      This is the main project at <a href="www.brewhouse.io">Brewhouse</a> where I got hired as an
      apprentice and grew my skills to be a Junior Developer. I've helped in various areas of
      the app, such as: Content Library, 2016 Pricing, Link Shortener & Sharing Banner

      The hardest part about building the MVP of Pixhug was the ask that the likes should be polled
      and it should be realtime or close to it. We had to create a service that will poll Facebook for
      likes as much as it could without getting rate limited. Maybe I'll write a blogpost on
      how we solved this problem.

    <p>
      The initial ask at Attendease was to migrate their database from MongoDB to PostgresQL but
      with the current state of the app at that time, we had to bring the test coverage up (using simplecov)
      and slowly change the syntax from a Mongo query to a SQL query.

      I came to the avenue spaces towards the middle of creating it's MVP while being an
      apprentice at <a href="www.brewhouse.io">Brewhouse</a>. Our lead designer created
      pixel perfect images that I had to copy with CSS. I've helped create the questionaire and
      added functionalities to their admin portal.
